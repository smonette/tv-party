## Motivation

This project was inspired by Connie Chang and Steph Monette's mutual love of discussing tv. After watching a really good show, we felt like we really wanted to discuss what happened, but didn't always know anyone else who watched the same things as us. We decided that this would be a great project to experiment with Socket.io and build a chatroom portal where you could discuss your shows with people all over the world.
